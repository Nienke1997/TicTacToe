# TicTacToe

This game is a classic copy of Tic Tac Toe. Where it is up to you to beat your opponent.
In order to do this, you have to be the first to have three X's or three O's in line.

The app checks whether the first Player or the second Player won, if the game ends in a draw and whether a move is valid.
It can be played in landscape and portrait layout. 

Furthermore, the game consists of a friendly user interface that indicates the moves with specific colours
and emphasizes the 'reset' button once the game is over.
